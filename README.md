AngularJs is a Javascript-based framework for developing single-page browser-based applications.
AngularJs works by extending the capabilities of web browsers.
Understanding HOW AngularJs does this is essential to becoming and expert AngularJs programmer.

This lecture:
- Describes how web browsers work. Specifically how browsers:
- Generate and process events.
- Parse HTML to construct the DOM and render it into pages.
- Describes how AngularJs extends both the browser's event-processing loop and its process for parsing, compiling and rendering HTML.
- Illustrate simple ways to 'sandbox' features of AngularJS so that you can try them outside of the context of a larger application.
